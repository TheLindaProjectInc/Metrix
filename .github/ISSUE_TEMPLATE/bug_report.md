<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Metrix Core.

General Metrix questions and/or support requests are best directed to the Metrixcoin Discord at https://discord.gg/sFDhZk4Nxb .

For reporting security issues, please log a ticket in the Metrixcoin discord in the first instance.

If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->
